   A SQL expression can now be assigned to a primary key attribute for an ORM
   flush in the same manner as ordinary attributes as described in
   :ref:`flush_embedded_sql_expressions` where the expression will be evaulated
   and then returned to the ORM using RETURNING, or in the case of pysqlite,
   works using the cursor.lastrowid attribute.Requires either a database that
   supports RETURNING (e.g. Postgresql, Oracle, SQL Server) or pysqlite.
