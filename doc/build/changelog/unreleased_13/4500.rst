   :tags: feature, engine
   :tickets: 4500

   Revised the formatting for :class:`.StatementError` when stringified. Each
   error detail is broken up over multiple newlines instead of spaced out on a
   single line.  Additionally, the SQL representation now stringifies the SQL
   statement rather than using ``repr()``, so that newlines are rendered as is.
