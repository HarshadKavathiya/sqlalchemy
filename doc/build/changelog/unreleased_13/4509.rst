   The :class:`.Alias` class and related subclasses :class:`.CTE`,
   :class:`.Lateral` and :class:`.TableSample` have been reworked so that it is
   not possible for a user to construct the objects directly.  These constructs
   require that the standalone construction function or selectable-bound method
   be used to instantiate new objects.
