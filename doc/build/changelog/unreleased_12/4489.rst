   Fixed fairly simple but critical issue where the
   :meth:`.SessionEvents.pending_to_persistent` event would be invoked for
   objects not just when they move from pending to persistent, but when they
   were also already persistent and just being updated, thus causing the event
   to be invoked for all objects on every update.
